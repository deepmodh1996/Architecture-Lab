Q.1
A)	1. mfc0/mft0 instructions transfer data between the exception registers and the general-purpose registers
		mfc0
			Moves data from coprocessor 0 register to general purpose register
		mtc0
			Moves data from general purpose register to coprocessor 0 register

	2. .set noat
			prevents SPIM from complaining about subsequent instructions that use register $at.
	   .set at
			reenables the warning

	3. Cause Register
		It is used to record the cause of the exception or interrupt before jumping to the handler code.

	4. EPC
		Register contains the following address of the instruction where the exception occurred


B) How to run ?
	run following command in folder containing modified exceptions file
		"spim -ef exceptions-deepmodh.s -f <filename.s>" where <filename.s> is path of .s file to be executed



Q.2 How to run
	run following command in folder containing modified exceptions file
		"spim -ef exceptions_misalign.s -f misalign.s"

Q.3
	Script is in q3.py
	data is in data.txt

	after running python q3.py; following result is obtained
		number of cycle in multicycle is : 
		646


		Number of clock cycle in single cycle is : 
		153

		Multi cycle is this much faster than single cycle : 
		1.18421052632

Note : data.txt can be generated by typing following command on terminal
		spim > data.txt
		load "gcd_noopt.s"
		step 5000
		exit
